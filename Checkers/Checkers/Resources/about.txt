A game of checkers implemented in C# using the MVVM design pattern, intended to be played on an 8x8 board. 
Players can use two types of pieces:

Man: a basic piece that moves one square forward diagonally and can jump over opposing pieces. It has an optional feature for multiple jumps which can be enabled or disabled by the player.
King: a piece that advances to the furthest row and gains the ability to move both forwards and backwards.
The game concludes when a player loses all their pieces, thereby declaring the opponent the winner.

The program features two primary menus:

File, which includes options like New Game, Save, Open, Allow Multiple Jumps, and Statistics.
Help, which provides details about the game in the About submenu.
