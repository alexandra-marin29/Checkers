This checkers game is crafted in C# using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, suitable for two players on an 8x8 board. The game includes two distinct types of pieces:

Man: This basic game piece can move diagonally forward by one square and has the capability to leap over opponent pieces. It features an optional multiple jumps setting, which players can activate or deactivate as desired.
King: Upon reaching the farthest row from its starting position, a piece is crowned a King, granting it the ability to move both forwards and backwards.
The game ends when a player has no pieces left, resulting in victory for their opponent.

The app includes two main menus:

File: This menu provides options such as New Game, Save, Open, Allow Multiple Jumps, and Statistics.
Help: Offers additional information about the game under the About submenu.
